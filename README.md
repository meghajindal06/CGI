Create an ecosystem that fulfills basic needs (warmth, human interaction, etc.).

Scarcity in location and availability, but not in resources, which are abundantly available and transportable by vehicles that exist

1. Overcapacity as a Service; use resources in current system efficitevely, right location right time. Connect ecosystems (mobility, transport, energy). Sky Scanner owned by us all. "Search gets inverted: instead of people searching for products, people search and compete for people". Connecting the dots, effectively connect to We use AI to sift through personal data. Ramping up to DAO, DO OR DIE the fllippening must happen.

Crowdfund through ICO to setup for development phase, with a fixed amount of coins. The intrinsic value of the is directly linked to Metcalfe's law.

2. Paradigm Shift; in the first phase we have developed a platform that can effectively connect capacity to availability through optimal deployment of existing resources. At some point the flippening happens: overcapacity turns into undercapacity and decisions need to be made on which assets/resources are needed to fill the gap. The platform moves to a DAO. Everyone's money on one big pile, able to invest in the required units.

3. The DAO has found optimal allocation for resources now and as the system grows. The system will grow, the value of the underlying coin grows. At some point there is enough value and the DAO will cover most of the system (let's say the world). At that point we have replaced overcapacity with overvalue. This overvalue can be released a form of basic income.
